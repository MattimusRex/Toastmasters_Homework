To run this application, first clone the repo into your Visual Studio repo folder. Then open the solution in Visual Studio 2019. 
VS 2017 may work, but it hasn't been tested. 
Press ctrl + F5 to run the application without debugging. If you get an error about project.assets.json missing, then you need to
open the nuget package manager console and run the "dotnet restore" command. If you see a pop about installing a cert, click yes 
and install it. A browser window should open with the application loaded at localhost.
The first time the application is run, it will create a database for storing the data.
